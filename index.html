    Hello, my name is Jean Benedict Nugroho. I am currently a junior in Purdue University majoring in Computer Engineering.
    I am passionate in having a career as a software engineer/developer because of its fun and challenging aspect.
    Aside from that, in the software career path, there is always something I can explore, experience, and be involved in,
    with the stream of dynamically changing technology.
    This makes me more intrigued to continually expand my knowledge while contributing to the industry.
    <br><br>
    I started by interning at Nehloo Interactive as a software development engineer intern.
    The opportunity allowed me to research and develop a web application page for XR (AR/VR) Experiences.
    In addition, I conduct my own personal projects outside my internship and also participated in a research project
    in order to further develop my skill set and work posture as an aspiring software engineer or developer.
